Supervised learning
. structured vs unstructured data -- ie, databases vs images/audio/text
. NNs good at both, but latter particularly significant
. deep learning effectiveness taken off b/c increase of data availability -- require more data
  to be effective, but with large quantities of _labeled_ data, more effective than traditional methods
  like regression
. m -- size of training set
. switch from sigmoid functions to relu functions
  -- sigmoid functions disadvantageous b/c at ends slope is close to 0, which slows learning
  -- with relu, gradient descent works much faster
