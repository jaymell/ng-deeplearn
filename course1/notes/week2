Notation
. n_x -- input size of x
. X matrix -- each individual test case is a column
 -- shape (n_x, m)
. Y matrix -- also columnar
 -- shape (1, m)
Logistic Regression
. y_hat = sigmoid( W*x + b )
  -- W is n_x dimensional vector
  -- b is real number
. sigmoid = 1 / (1 + e^-z)
. think of z as the x axis on a sigmoid graph -- large z makes denom small -> close to 1
  -- small z make denom large -- close to 0
  -- goal is for params W and b to lead to accurate values of sigmoid function given inputs
